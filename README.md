Microscopy image segmentation for area measurement
==================================================

Tool to measure area in microscopy sampels. E.g. measure background and
cell. Can be trained to recognize multiple different area types. Uses a
method akin to gaussian mixture models. This is a quick hack for now.

Required tools
--------------

Python, numpy, scipy, scikit image and others.

Windows and MacOSX users can install Anaconda to get all required
dependencies: http://www.anaconda.com/
